# `processes`

This example shows how to spawn processes and use pipes as exposed by the Rust standard library. While one of my examples will only run on *nix, that is because I am using `echo` and `grep` to showcase a use of pipes, but the method by which I set up the pipe is 100% cross-platform and will compile and run on Windows, Mac, Linux, and whatever other operating systems Rust supports. If you want to use the *nix idea of fork -> exec, there is a crate that exposed *nix platform apis including those found in the libc "unistd.h" header. With this, you have access to fork, exec, dup, and other such functions at the cost of it only working on *nix systems. See https://docs.rs/nix/0.19.1/nix/unistd/index.html for the documentation of the `nix` crate and the bindings to the `"unistd.h"` functions.
